Introduction
------------

The [Concise Binary Object Representation](http://cbor.io/)
([RFC 7049](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049)) is a data format
whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size,
fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.

It's a pure Lua implementation, without dependency.
